h1. Lua Devtools

This package provides a few tools to make your life as a Lua developer better. It's aimed primarily for use in projects where Lua it the primary language rather than embedded.

It contains:

* ilua - "A better interactive Lua command line":http://lua-users.org/wiki/InteractiveLua that prints return values as you go along (by Steve Donovan)
* debugger - A "command-line debugger":http://luaforge.net/projects/clidebugger/ with readline support (by Dave Nichols)

I am not the author of these tools, I only added readline support to the debugger and packaged them.

Since the original authors did not release their work under any license, this package is released under the "WTFPL":http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/.

h2. Usage

To install, clone this repository and do "luarocks make devtools-*.rockspec". I may eventually put the rockspec on Luaforge but I'm just banging this out in 10 minutes right now and it's not exactly polished yet.

h3. ilua

Just run @ilua@ from the command line.

h3. debugger

Inclue devtools.debugger in your Lua program and execute it on the command line. The @pause@ function will give control to the debugger, where you can then step through code, watch variables, etc.

<pre>
<code>
require 'luarocks.require'
require 'devtools.debugger'
pause("this will pause and give control to the debugger")
print "hello world!"
</code>
</pre>
